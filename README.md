# Database-Analyzer
My first ever programming(?) project of making a database analyzer utilizing AI.  
I dream  
and  
Gpt works  

Hi, I am a Korean job seeker, who is absolutely, unbelievably, incomprehensibly new to programming and tech stuffs.\
So, although I highly doubt it would happen, if anyone were to stumble upon my page and take a look\
please bare with me haha.

I am currently undertaking a '1 month AI development and programming course followed by a 3 Month internship(chance)'.\
At the end of the lecture course, participants are required to make a presentation on a project they worked on.\
This project will also be likely used in the participants' portfolios, so everybody will probably be putting a lot of effort into it.\

For my project, I decided to build a database analyzer.\
My original idea was to make it so that;\
1. a user would upload any type of database(text, excel, DBMS)\
2. and AI would analyze the meanings of each table, data, and values(format)\

I then talked with my best buddy, GPT.\
Talking to it made me realize that what I needed to do first was to understand how database management systems work.\
So my current goal is to make a sample database on MySQL, which I chose because it was the very first DBMS I heard about XD.\

I will probably write down any more stuff in the Devlog folder.\
Thank you?\
