# Database-Analyzer
My first ever programming(?) project of making a database analyzer utilizing AI.  
I dream  
and  
Gpt works  

Hi, I am a Korean job seeker, who is currently undertaking a '1 month AI development and programming course followed by a 3 month internship(chance)'./
At the end of our course, participants are required to make a presentation on a project they worked on./
This project will also be likely used in the participants' portfolios, so everybody will probably putting a lot of effort into it./

For my project, I decided to make a simple database analyzer./
