Well, I guess I never really like writing, just writing in general,\
but I now realize how hard it is to keep documentation

Anyways, this is probably my 5th day working on the project, was actually supposed to make a presentation on my project today, but... haha...\

The current status of my project is as such\
1. Analyzer app
   - Contains codes for connecting and projecting(?) a database.(want to change the app name to database, but seems like thats a whole another process;;)
   - main bases are: DB Connect / Table viewer / Table selecter / Analysis page
2. GPT app
   - Contains codes for GPT usage
   - Working on how to actually utilize this one...\

Well then I'll get to work.
