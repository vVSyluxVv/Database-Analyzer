This is the day I begin using github.\
I am still figuring out how I should progress through my project.\
But I hope trying to use github as a method of documentation and as a cloud, would help me in my journey.

I am currently making a sample database/dataset using MySQL, and MySQL workbench.

It contains these informations(pk=primarykey, fk=foreignkey)\
1. Customers: id(pk), name, email, signup date, membership(fk)
2. Products: id(pk), name, category, price
3. Orders: id(pk), customer id(fk), product name(fk), quantity, date, unit price(fk), total price(calculated), membership discount rate(fk), final price(calculated)
4. Membership: id(pk), name, discount rate

It is taking some time because GPT is doing all the coding and advising me on how to make them actually work, or editing them in the workbench.\
I plan to make it a bit more complicated by adding in a few more tables.\
ex) 5. Category: id(pk), name, number of parent categories, number of child categories, number of products within this category

Here is today's work
